You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

1. Filtering: "Show only the animals with animal.age larger than 3 weeks."
2. Sorting: "Show all data sorted by animal.age_in_days."
3. Answer questions about the data: "How does animal.species affect the animal.age?"
4. Plot data: "Show me how to plot animals by animal sex as a bar chart."

You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
