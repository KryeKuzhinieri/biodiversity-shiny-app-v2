You can use this sidebar to filter and sort the data based on the columns available in the table. Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can ask me:

1. Filtering: "Show only the species with kingdom plantae."
2. Sorting: "Show all data sorted by sex."
3. Answer questions about the data: "How does family affect scientific name?"
4. Plot data: "Show me how to plot species by country name."

You can also say "Reset" to clear the current filter/sort, or "Help" for more usage tips.
